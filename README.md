# Lethe
Simple YouTube playback bot for Discord. Warning: Lethe is absolutely not stable at all! It is likely to either not run at all or crash soon after running. If you experience anything like that, please report an [issue](https://github.com/meew0/Lethe/issues)!

## Installation

If you're on Windows, you should install node-opus before everything else, as there may be problems with the installation:
```
$ npm install node-opus
```
If there are any, follow the instructions on how to fix them. See issue #9 for more information.

Then, install [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html). Depending on your system, it may already be preinstalled (run `ffmpeg` in a terminal, if it works, then it's installed). On Windows, after installing it, make sure it's in your PATH environment variable, otherwise it won't be found by Lethe.

Finally, install Lethe itself:
```
$ npm install meew0/Lethe
```

As a last step, you might want to comment out line 71 in `discord.js/src/Voice/VoiceConnection.js`. It should read `this.instream.destroy();`. This may work around hydrabolt/discord.js#60, which prevents `next` and `destroy` from working.

## Usage
Run Lethe using the email and password as command line arguments:

```
$ node lethe.js email@example.com hunter2 YouTube-api-key(optional)
```

Then, run commands over Discord using the bot's username mention as a prefix, for example:

```
@Bot init
```

Where "Bot" is your bot's username.

## Commands

`init [voice channel name]`: Initializes Lethe and binds it to the text channel this command was run in and the specified voice channel. If no voice channel was specified, the first available one will be used (usually General).  
`destroy`: Destroys Lethe's binding. This stops the current playback and unbinds it from the text and voice channel.

The following commands will only work inside the text channel Lethe was bound to.

`yt [id]`: Queues a video from YouTube to be played. If this is the only song in the queue, start playback. `queue [id]` does the same thing, as does `play [id]`. `id` can be replaced with a keyword used to save a video using `save`.  
`list`: Lists the videos on the queue.  
`link`: Gets the link to view the video currently playing.  
`next`: Stops the current playback and skips to the next video in the queue.  
`save [id] [keyword]` Saves a video under a keyword. It can later be played back using `yt`.  
`time`: Gets the time the video is currently at.  
`yq [search-value]`: Searches a youtube video that matches the search value.  
`pl [playlist-id]`: Queues the 50 first videos of a playlist.
